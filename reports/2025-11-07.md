- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a follow-up Peer Review Report on the exclusion from the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk of transactions with non-financial counterparties established in a third country.
- This follow-up Review found that competent authorities continue to largely assess CVA risk sufficiently, using different approaches which are fit for purpose in satisfying the regulatory requirements and the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) Guidelines.
- Furthermore, since the 2023 Report, all competent authorities have made some progress in strengthening their CVA risk assessments and addressing the follow-up measures suggested as part of that Report.

- This paper serves as a reference guide on the effects of “standard” monetary policy shocks on output and prices, based on harmonised simulation exercises conducted across models of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), meta-analysis of existing empirical literature for the euro area, and selected works on heterogeneity and non-linearities in the monetary transmission mechanism as captured by empirical models.
- Our analysis starts by comparing the effects of monetary policy shocks as estimated by structural, semi-structural and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, and identifying the main sources of heterogeneity – most notably via the specification of monetary policy rules, the slope of the Phillips curve, the role of real rigidities and financial frictions, and

- The European Banking Authority (EBA) updated today the aggregated overview on the implementation and transposition of the revised Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) and Investment Firms Directive (IFD) packages.

- The information, published in an aggregated format, provides an updated overview of how Competent Authorities across the EU have implemented key aspects of the prudential framework for both credit institutions and investment firms.

- This paper studies the effect of alternative monetary policy responses and the implementation of different fiscal policy measures to an inflationary shock in a monetary union, through the lens of a global DSGE model calibrated to the euro area.
- We find that a more aggressive monetary policy response mitigates the inflation surge, but has a detrimental impact on economic activity that imposes a stronger increase of public debt, reducing the fiscal policy space.
- We also find that some fiscal policy measures may alleviate the negative impact of the shock on households and firms, but do not significantly alter the inflation dynamics: a reduction of consumption taxes reduces inflation only temporarily, while an increase of transfers or of public investment slightly increase inflation init
