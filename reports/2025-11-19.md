- Using a large survey of euro area consumers, we conduct an experiment in which respondents report how they would adjust their labor market participation, hours worked, and job search effort (if not employed) in response to randomly assigned windfall gain scenarios.
- Windfall gains reduce labor supply, but only when the gains are substantial.
- At the extensive margin, gains of €25,000 or less have no effects, while gains between €50,000 and €100,000 reduce the probability of working by 1.5 to 3.5 percentage points.
- At the intensive margin, small gains produce no impact, while gains above €50,000 lead to a reduction of approximately one hour of work per week.
