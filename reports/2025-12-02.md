**[1] [Global or regional safe assets: evidence from bond substitution patterns](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3159~a7bae31d9c.en.pdf)**

- This paper provides novel empirical evidence on portfolio rebalancing in international bond markets through the prism of investors’ demand for bonds.
- Using a granular dataset of global government and corporate bond holdings by mutual funds domiciled in the world’s two largest currency areas, I estimate heterogeneous and time varying demand elasticities for bonds.
- Safe assets such as US Treasuries or German Bunds face especially inelastic demand from investment funds compared to riskier bonds.
- But spillovers from these safe assets to global bond markets are strikingly different.

- I study how demand-supply narrative disagreement between general and specialized newspapers can explain households’ absolute gap in inflation expectations with experts.
- I measure inflation narratives via a Causality Extraction algorithm that can identify causal relationships between events in a text and, hence, extract the perceived triggers of inflation.
- Causal relations can explain why narratives affect people’s beliefs and cannot be captured by dictionary methods, topic models, and word embeddings.
- I then classify inflation narratives into demand and supply narratives based on their focus on demand and supply triggers.
