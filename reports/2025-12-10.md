**[1] [The climate-biodiversity-pollution nexus: the pricing of environmental credit risks for European](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3164~d0acf27eba.en.pdf)**

- This study examines how euro area banks factor pollution-induced biodiversity risks into lending decisions, using data from 832 banks and 5,000 major polluters.
- Our results show that banks are increasingly pricing these risks by adjusting loan-to-value ratios and interest rates.
- Banks adjust lending conditions in line with EU pollution and biodiversity protection legislation, particularly for companies with large pollution footprints near biodiversity-protected areas or those contributing to Environmental Quality Standards failures of downstream surface waters.
- The former is driven primarily by banks’ adoption of biodiversity policies and public commitments to the Equator Principles, while the latter is a result of regulatory risks.
