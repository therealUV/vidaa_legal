**[1] [The EBA consults on Guidelines on supervisory independence](https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-consults-guidelines-supervisory-independence)**

- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a consultation on its Guidelines on supervisory independence of competent authorities under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD).
- Risks to supervisory independence pose challenges to the soundness of supervision and good governance and new requirements in the CRD introduce measures to manage them.
- These Guidelines further clarify the arrangements that competent authorities should have in place to prevent and manage conflicts of interest.
- The consultation runs until 23 January 2026.

- Evidence from the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) – based on a one-off set of questions introduced in the July 2025 wave – suggests that the majority of car purchases in July 2025 were of combustion engine vehicles, followed by hybrid and fully electric cars.
- Most purchases were of second-hand cars, reflecting concerns about the value of new cars depreciating quickly, particularly among high-income households, as well as limited access to affordable financing options, especially among low-income households.
- Most respondents in the July 2025 CES wave had no plans to buy a car within the next year, with economic and financial uncertainty and a preference for alternative modes of transportation playing a role, particularly for low-income households.
- While demand for hybrid cars

**[3] [Monetary policy transmission to investment: evidence from a survey on enterprise finance](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3150~46ca488196.en.pdf)**

- We study how survey-based measures of funding needs and availability influence the transmission of euro area monetary policy to investment.
- We first provide evidence that funding needs are primarily driven by fundamentals, while perceived funding availability captures financial conditions.
- Using these two measures, we assess how the effectiveness of monetary policy varies with fundamentals and financial conditions.
- Our results indicate that monetary policy is most effective when firms’ fundamentals are strong.

**[5] [Investment funds and the monetary-macroprudential policy interplay](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3151~464990a4a8.en.pdf)**

- Is there an undesired side-effect of banking regulation on the non-bank sector?
- How effective is the non-bank transmission channel of monetary policy in the presence of macroprudential policy?
- Using a state-dependent local projection approach and a rich dataset capturing macroprudential tightening across euro area countries, we present strong cross-country heterogeneity.
- In financially conservative markets (Germany, France, the Netherlands), tight monetary policy combined with stricter macroprudential measures significantly contracts investment fund assets.

**[32] [Investment funds and the monetary-macroprudential policy interplay](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3151~464990a4a8.en.pdf)**

- Is there an undesired side-effect of banking regulation on the non-bank sector?
- How effective is the non-bank transmission channel of monetary policy in the presence of macroprudential policy?
- Using a state-dependent local projection approach and a rich dataset capturing macroprudential tightening across euro area countries, we present strong cross-country heterogeneity.
- In financially conservative markets (Germany, France, the Netherlands), tight monetary policy combined with stricter macroprudential measures significantly contracts investment fund assets.

**[33] [The heterogenous transmission of monetary policy to household credit](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/economic-bulletin/focus/2025/html/ecb.ebbox202507_07~80741b85e7.en.html)**

- Monetary policy affects household credit heterogeneously through multiple channels.
- On the supply side, monetary policy tightening is typically thought to have a more adverse effect on lower-income households.
- The ECB Consumer Expectations Survey supports this assumption, with lower-income households reporting tighter constraints on credit access and higher consumer loan rejection rates than households with higher incomes during the recent tightening period.
- That said, on the demand side, survey responses indicate that lower-income households did not reduce their mortgage loan applications, unlike higher-income households, and in fact even increased their consumer loan applications, during this tightening phase.

- This article uses data from the Consumer Expectations Survey to examine the inflation episode of 2021-23, the mortgage rate responses and the perceived and actual effects of these developments on inequality.
- Public perceptions of inequality rose sharply during the inflation surge, with 73% of households reporting an increase.
- Cost-of-living pressures were cited as the main driver.
- By contrast, standard measures of income, wealth and consumption inequality calculated using data from the survey remained broadly stable in the euro area between 2022 and 2025.

- As an active member of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the European Banking Authority (EBA) is proud to announce the release of the NGFS Declaration on the Economic Cost of Climate Inaction on the occasion of the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil.
- The declaration underscores the mounting macroeconomic and financial risks of delayed climate action and reaffirms the NGFS’s commitment to supporting a well-managed transition to a low-carbon economy.

**[39] [Joining forces: why banks syndicate credit](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3149~4fb287ab1f.en.pdf)**

- Banks can grant loans to firms bilaterally or in syndicates.
- We study this choice by combining bilateral loan data with syndicated loan data.
- We show that loan size alone does not adequately explain syndication.
- Instead, banks’ ability to manage risks and firm riskiness drive the choice to syndicate.

- Monetary aggregates provide valuable information about the monetary policy transmission and the business cycle.
- This paper applies machine learning methods, namely Learning Vector Quantisation (LVQ) and its distinction-sensitive extension (DSLVQ), to identify turning points in euro area M1 and M3.
- We benchmark performance against the Bry–Boschan algorithm and standard classifiers.
- Our results show that LVQ detects M1 turning points with only a three-month delay, halving the six-month confirmation lag of Bry–Boschan dating.
