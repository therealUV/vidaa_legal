- This paper studies the effects of fiscal policy announcements on household expectations.
- We document announcements of price-related expansionary fiscal measures in response to the cost-of-living crisis in the four largest euro area economies and exploit the exogenous timing of fiscal actions relative to household survey participation to estimate their causal effects.
- Following fiscal announcements, households revise their beliefs: inflation perceptions rise, and unemployment perceptions fall.
- The latter effect persists into short-run unemployment expectations, while inflation expectations remain unchanged and suggest households perceived inflationary pressures as temporary.
