- Euro area insurers manage several trillion euro in assets and take a long‑term investment perspective.
- To counteract the long period of low interest rates, they have shifted towards holding more alternative and less liquid assets.
- As a result, their balance sheets have become less liquid and more sensitive to market conditions overall.
- Meanwhile, their holdings of sovereign bonds show a significant home bias, which may have even increased with quantitative easing.

- Exploiting three decades of detailed regional data for Germany, we find that when the Green Party is successful at the polls, local hazardous emissions decline.
- The level of political representation matters, too.
- Green politicians’ gaining influence at county level is followed largely by a decline in air pollutants that have an immediate adverse health effect.
- In contrast, when the Green party joins the state government, only greenhouse gas emissions that affect the welfare of future generations via climate change decline.
