- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on draft amendments to the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on certain prudential requirements for central securities depositories (CSDs) and designated credit institutions offering ‘banking-type ancillary services’.
- The proposed amendments reflect changes introduced by the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) Refit, notably allowing  banking CSDs to provide banking-type ancillary services to other CSDs.
- This consultation runs until 3 March 2026.
- A public hearing will be held on 12 January.

**[3] [Estimating the natural rate of interest in a macro-finance yield curve model](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3160~d48f8b9d45.en.pdf)**

- Using a novel macro-finance model we infer jointly the equilibrium real interest rate r*, trend inflation, interest rate expectations, and bond risk premia for the United States.
- In the model r* plays a dual macro-finance role: as the benchmark real interest rate that closes the output gap and as the time-varying long-run real interest rate that determines the level of the yield curve.
- Our estimated r* declines over the last decade, with estimation uncertainty being relatively contained.
- We show that both macro and financial information is important to infer r*.

**[5] [The ESCB forecasting models: what are they and what are they good for?](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op381.en.pdf)**

- This report provides a comprehensive overview of the models and tools used for macroeconomic projections within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).
- These include semi-structural models, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, time series models and specialised satellite models tailored to particular questions or country-specific aspects.
- Each type of model has its own strengths and weaknesses and can help answer different questions.
- The models should therefore be seen as complementary rather than mutually exclusive.
