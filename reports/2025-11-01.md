- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its second Report on the benchmarking of national loan enforcement frameworks across the EU Member States.
- The Report, which was compiled in response to the EU Commission’s call for advice in the context of the Savings and Investment Union’s agenda, calculates the benchmarks for loan recovery outcomes for the EU 27 aggregates and for the individual Member States.
- The results highlight a high degree of dispersion among different categories of loans, and across the EU27 Member States, for most of the benchmarks and loan categories.
- In addition, the Report underscores the importance of certain elements related to both the legal framework and the judicial capacity to improve the recovery outcomes.
