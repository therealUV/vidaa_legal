- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today released its Autumn 2025 risk assessment Report (RAR), confirming that EU/EEA banks remain strong in capital, liquidity, profitability and asset quality.
- However, the EBA calls for continued vigilance as geopolitical uncertainty, market volatility and increasing operational risks persist.
- The Report is published alongside the 2025 EU-wide transparency exercise, providing detailed and comparable data for 119 banks across 25 countries of the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), and is supplemented by the Autumn 2025 Risk Assessment Questionnaire (RAQ).

- We employ 68 quarters of data – including from non-public supervisory sources – to study how 17 US and 17 euro-area banks balance the risk of breaching regulatory requirements against the cost of maintaining and speedily restoring “management” buffers.
- We find that steady-state management buffer targets systematically declined and regulatory risk tolerance (RRT) rose following the Great Financial Crisis, especially at banks experiencing a stronger increase in capital requirements.
- As a sign that RRT is a conscious choice, banks facing more volatile management buffer shocks set higher management buffer targets.
- High-RRT banks tend to respond to a depletion of their management buffers by cutting lending, whereas low-RRT banks reduce the riskiness but not the volume of their assets —
