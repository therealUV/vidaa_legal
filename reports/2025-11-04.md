**[1] [​The EBA consults on Guidelines on authorisation of third country branches under the Capital Requirements Directive](https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-consults-guidelines-authorisation-third-country-branches-under-capital-requirements-directive)**

- ​The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on Guidelines on authorisation of third-country branches (TCBs) under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD).
- The Guidelines are another piece of regulation implementing the new EU framework applicable to TCBs, contributing to the harmonised access to the EU market and to the consistent application of such a new regime.
- The consultation runs until 3 February 2026.

**[2] [The market share of EU subsidiaries of third country banking groups remains stable at 9.8% of total assets](https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/market-share-eu-subsidiaries-third-country-banking-groups-remains-stable-98-total-assets)**

- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published two Reports on the market share of subsidiaries of non-EU banks in the EU, as well as on EU banks’ assets and liabilities in foreign currencies.
- The market share of EU subsidiaries of third country banking groups amounts to 9.8% of total assets as of December 2023 (down from 10.17% a year earlier).
- The Report indicates that EU/EEA banks currently hold nearly 32% of their exposures in foreign currencies and receive 21.1% of their total funding in foreign currencies.
- This marks an upward trend since December 2023.

**[3] [Banking on assumptions? How banks model deposit maturities](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3140~68afb9df75.en.pdf)**

- How do banks manage the behavioural maturity of non-maturing deposits (NMDs)?
- Using a rich and confidential dataset, we investigate how banks model deposit maturities based on internal assumptions.
- Although NMDs are contractually floating-rate liabilities with zero maturity, banks reallocate them across different maturity buckets using models that reflect past customer behaviour.
- Notably, only 20% of NMDs are treated as having zero maturity, while about 10% are assigned maturities beyond seven years.
