### Briefing (~200 words)

The key themes across the items [1] to [4] revolve around the legal authority and operational robustness of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) in managing banking crises, particularly in the context of the resolution scheme for Banco Popular Español. The General Court's orders consistently dismissed annulment actions from various parties, citing a manifest lack of legal foundation and, in some cases, a lack of jurisdiction. This reinforces the SRM's role and the legal framework governing credit institutions and investment firms, indicating that affected stakeholders must comply with the SRM's resolution measures.

The implications of these rulings suggest a strong judicial endorsement of the SRM's authority, which may deter future legal challenges against its decisions. The decisions also clarify the scope of judicial review available under the SRM, emphasizing the need for substantial legal grounds in any future actions.

In contrast, item [5] discusses the Commission's amendment of the Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring non-financial undertakings, extending the application period and broadening eligibility criteria. This change impacts EU member states and non-financial entities, requiring them to adapt to new compliance obligations to access state aid. Together, these items highlight ongoing regulatory developments in both financial and non-financial sectors within the EU.
