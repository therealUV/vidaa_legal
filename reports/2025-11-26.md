- I examine how households adjust the quality of their purchases in response to adverse economic shocks.
- Using household scanner data from Germany, I document heterogeneous responses across income levels.
- Higher-income households tend to reduce the quality of the goods they purchase, whereas lower-income households, who typically consume lower-quality goods, show a limited propensity to trade down, likely due to a limited ability to do so.
- To assess the equilibrium effects of an aggregate shift in demand toward lower-quality varieties, I implement a shift-share research design.

- Linkages between euro area banks and entities in the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector may lead to the emergence of systemic risk in at least two fields.
- First, the banking sector receives short-term deposit, repo and debt securities liabilities from NBFI entities.
- Such liabilities may be prone to flight risk and difficult to substitute.
- Second, euro area banks provide credit to NBFI entities which follow leveraged investment strategies.
