**[6] [Repo collateral reuse and liquidity windfalls](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3147~6c60cabb50.en.pdf)**

- Collateral reuse in repo markets helps entities meet short-term funding needs, maintain market efficiency, and anchor collateral valuations, although it creates risks through interconnectedness.
- A prominent view in the literature is that securities dealers use their market position to obtain temporary free-cash wedges from differences in collateral requirements when reusing collateral, so-called “liquidity windfalls”.
- By affecting dealers’ funding structures, such windfalls could influence yield curve determination, leverage, and monetary policy transmission.
- Yet the evidence has been largely theoretical, with limited empirical work.
