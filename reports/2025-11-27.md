- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Peer Review assessing how effectively supervisors implement and supervise diversity policies, specifically gender diversity, within the management bodies of financial institutions.
- The Review found that most of the competent authorities assessed have largely or fully met the benchmarks set and adequately supervised and implemented gender diversity policies.
- The Peer Review looked at six competent authorities, focusing on how they applied the respective requirements laid down in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and EBA Guidelines across six key benchmarks.

- Trade turmoil in April 2025 saw a marked change in cross-asset behaviour compared with typical patterns.
- Notably, the US dollar depreciated strongly while US Treasury yields rose – the opposite of what usually happens in a risk-off environment.
- This prompted discussions as to whether the safe-haven properties of US dollar-denominated assets might be changing.
- This is particularly important for euro area financial stability since euro area investors hold US dollar-denominated securities in an amount equivalent to €6 trillion, which represents a significant share of their portfolios.
