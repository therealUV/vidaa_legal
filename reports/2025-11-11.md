- We study heterogeneity in households’ credit across nine European countries (Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, and Slovakia) during 2022-2024 using granular credit register data.
- We first document substantial between- and within-country variation in mortgage and consumer lending by borrower age, loan maturity, and interest rate fixation.
- We then quantify the passthrough of the ECB’s recent tightening cycle to household borrowing costs, and assess its heterogeneous impact across households.
- Pass-through is nearly complete for mortgages (around 0.9) but considerably weaker for consumer credit (around 0.4).

- Banks trade off short-term losses on deposits against long-term profits from cross-selling other products to new depositors.
- This strategy is especially attractive when policy rates are low and future sales are more valuable.
- Therefore, deposit rates move less than policy rates: banks keep them relatively higher when policy rates fall, and relatively lower when policy rates rise.
- As returns on other financial assets follow policy rates more closely, this makes deposits relatively less attractive for depositors at higher policy rates.

- In the latest round of the European Commission’s biannual Standard Eurobarometer survey, a record 83% of euro area respondents expressed support for the euro – the highest level since the introduction of the single currency.
- Using the survey microdata, we show that this rise is broad-based across countries and sociodemographic groups, and that cross-country differences have narrowed significantly.
- Respondents who reported experiencing more of the benefits of the euro – such as easier price comparisons, business, travel or banking – are more likely to view the euro as “a good thing” for the EU.
- Our findings suggest that euro area citizens have now fully embraced the euro.
