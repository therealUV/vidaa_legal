- Debate over China’s growing trade surplus has resurfaced amid US-China trade tensions, geoeconomic shifts and global imbalances.
- This box shows that the surplus reflects two distinct dynamics: persistently weak imports and surging exports.
- On the import side, structural policies promoting domestic substitution, trade restrictions and sluggish demand have curbed demand for foreign goods.
- On the export side, subdued domestic demand has led firms to redirect excess production capacity abroad, consistent with the “vent-for-surplus” mechanism.

- Oil prices have declined in recent months owing to a persistent oversupply in the market.
- A key driver has been a shift in the stance of OPEC+.
- The group has been increasing oil supply at a rapid pace despite already low prices, marking a clear departure from its historical role as a market stabiliser.
- A similar shift in behaviour occurred in 2014, when oil prices declined sharply and remained persistently low.
