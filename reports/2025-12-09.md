**[2] [Misestimating house values: consequences for household finance](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3163~ccdc145e15.en.pdf)**

- This study examines the effect of systematic household misestimation of home prices on financial decisions, including stockholdings, consumption, and asset allocation.
- Using exogenous variation in house values, mortgage debt, and homeowner misestimation identified through differences in local housing market characteristics, we find that a $60,000 increase in house overvaluation (approximately one standard deviation) results in a 1.1 to 1.9 percent decrease in risky stockholdings, a 1.5 to 4.3 percent increase in consumption, and a 1.3 to 2.5 percent increase in the share of risk-free assets over liquid wealth.
- The results highlight the need to better understand how housing wealth and beliefs about house values affect portfolio choice, spending, and overall household finance.

**[3] [Asset prices, wealth inequality, and welfare: safe assets as a solution](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3162~339eaf8c4a.en.pdf)**

- Can rising asset prices reduce wealth inequality?
- This paper builds a continuous-time heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium in which entrepreneurs hold risky private capital and traditional savers hold safe assets.
- Safe-asset expansions—via financial innovation, public debt, or a stable equity bubble—operate through a single pass-through: they lower entrepreneurs’ undiversified risk exposure, compress risk premia, and raise the interest rate.
- This slows entrepreneurial wealth accumulation and redistributes wealth toward traditional savers, so inequality falls even as risky asset valuations rise.
