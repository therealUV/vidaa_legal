- Euro area insurers manage several trillion euro in assets and take a long-term investment perspective.
- They hold more alternative and less liquid assets than in the past, partly resulting from the long period of low interest rates until 2022.
- As a result, their balance sheets have become less liquid and more sensitive to market conditions overall.
- Meanwhile their holdings of sovereign bonds show significant home bias, which may have even increased with quantitative easing policies.

**[43] [Nature at risk: Implications for the euro area economy and financial stability](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op380.en.pdf)**

- Degraded ecosystems undermine productivity, disrupt supply chains and heighten vulnerability to shocks, creating risks for the real economy and the financial sector.
- Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation also pose a growing risk to price stability, with increasing evidence that ecosystem shocks contribute to inflationary pressures in the euro area.
- This paper moves from dependency mapping to a risk-based assessment of the euro area economy and banks, applying the nature value-at-risk (NVaR) framework, which links biophysical shocks to ecosystem services with sectoral-production functions1.
- Water-related risks, including flood protection, surface water and groundwater scarcity, and water quality, emerge as the most material for the euro area economy.
