- The severity and the plausibility of stress test scenarios are crucial elements for interpreting the results and ensuring the credibility of stress-testing exercises.
- This article introduces a comprehensive framework for assessing scenario severity and plausibility in the context of the adverse scenarios used in the EU-wide stress tests.
- Two families of indicators are developed, characterised by a backward-looking and a forward-looking perspective.
- Backward-looking indicators compare the scenario with historical regularities, using as key metrics deviations from baseline projections and comparisons with the extreme values of key variables.

- As authorities across the euro area work towards including climate risks into regular stress-testing frameworks, this article offers a starting point for assessing bank resilience to climate risks that materialise under a short-term horizon.
- This is relevant since acute physical risks and abrupt policy changes can also materialise at short notice and affect the balance sheet of financial institutions.
- The analysis uses an adverse macroeconomic backdrop that combines the EBA’s adverse scenario with the Network for Greening the Financial System’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NGFS NDCs) scenarios.
- It extends the EU-wide 2025 stress test results by incorporating both transition and acute physical climate risks into the credit risk assessment for non-financial corporations by me

- This article expands the 2025 EU-wide stress test by incorporating a system-wide perspective to capture contagion risks across investment funds and insurance corporations alongside the banking sector.
- It examines potential short-term contagion effects under the EBA’s adverse scenario as financial institutions adjust their balance sheets in response to stress.
- These adjustments would result in additional average CET1 ratio depletion of 29 basis points, increasing first-round effects by 12%.
- Among institutional sectors, investment funds, in particular equity funds, face the greatest losses under the EBA’s adverse scenario, while banks with less sophisticated hedging capabilities are also significantly affected.

- This overview article provides an introduction to the 2025 Macroprudential Stress Test Extension Report (MaSTER), released as the 32nd edition of the Macroprudential Bulletin, which investigates how the EU-wide stress test and its extensions provide a broader assessment of the systemic vulnerabilities of euro area banks.
- The 2025 EU-wide stress test results are expanded via a top-down model-based toolkit to assess additional risks, perform policy simulation exercises, and present novel approaches to gauging the severity of the adverse scenario.
- In this article, lessons are drawn from these extended stress tests through a comparative analysis of capital depletion.
- Overall, available results support authorities’ cautious approach to capital buffers.

- Stress test simulations can enhance our understanding of the interplay between bank actions, the real economy and macroprudential buffers.
- Leveraging BEAST, the ECB’s workhorse top-down stress test model, this article explores impacts stemming from bank behavioural reactions by simulating them under the adverse scenario of the 2025 EU-wide stress test.
- The article shows that allowing banks to adjust their balance sheets only improves their capital ratios to a minor extent compared with simulations where they are assumed to keep their balance sheets constant.
- However, these reactions trigger negative credit supply shocks, exacerbating the downturn.
