**[1] [The AML/CFT colleges framework is maturing, the EBA finds](https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/amlcft-colleges-framework-maturing-eba-finds)**

- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its fifth and final Report on the Functioning of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Colleges.
- The Report finds that colleges are effective tools to facilitate information exchange, which improved the effectiveness of AML/CFT supervision within the Union.
- The Report also finds that a key objective of the framework is yet to be fulfilled, i.e to address issues that affect several group entities in a coordinated manner.
