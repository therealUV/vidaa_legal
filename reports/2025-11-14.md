**[4] [Exploring EU-UK trade and investment four years after Brexit](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op379.en.pdf)**

- This paper looks at how Brexit has affected trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) between the United Kingdom and the EU.
- In 2020 the United Kingdom and the EU signed the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) , establishing the post-Brexit relationship and, in particular, a tariff-free area for goods produced in either of the two economies.
- However, non-tariff barriers to the trading of goods and services have emerged.
- Moreover, the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU has affected its attractiveness as an investment target.

- This paper introduces a novel methodology to enhance the granularity of Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables.
- While our general methodology can be applied to any products of interest, we show that the well-documented distortions caused by sectoral aggregation in ICIO tables are particularly pronounced for products with a low substitutability, such as those essential to the green transition (e.g.
- electric batteries, rare earths).
- We therefore apply our framework to construct a disaggregated ICIO table that singles out 129 products essential to the energy transition.

**[38] [And yet we move: evidence on job-to-job transitions in the euro area](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/economic-bulletin/focus/2025/html/ecb.ebbox202507_04~887d2bb852.en.html)**

- Job-to-job transitions in the euro area are a complementary indicator to standard labour market statistics.
- These flows, defined as transitions between jobs without a spell of unemployment, capture important adjustment mechanisms in addition to the unemployment rate.
- Using administrative data for Germany, Spain and France, our analysis highlights the procyclical nature of job-to-job transitions: mobility declines during downturns and rises during expansions.
- Heterogeneity is also evident across occupations and age groups.

**[40] [Not all prices disinflate alike: disentangling the dynamics of sticky and flexible-price items](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/economic-bulletin/focus/2025/html/ecb.ebbox202507_06~c6af720c0d.en.html)**

- This box draws on micro price evidence on the frequency of price adjustments to disentangle the roles of sticky and flexible-price items in shaping recent disinflation dynamics in the euro area.
- Inflation of sticky core items has eased only gradually, while flexible core inflation has returned closer to its pre-pandemic average.
- Among subcategories, flexible goods drove the surge in non-energy industrial goods inflation, while the persistence of services inflation reflects contributions from both sticky and flexible-price items.
- The recent persistence of sticky core inflation underscores the roles of past cost shocks and elevated wage pressures.
