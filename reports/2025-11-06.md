- This paper investigates whether geopolitical risk causes a reduction in bank lending.
- In particular, it focuses on how the increase in geopolitical risk stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected euro area bank credit supply.
- Matching granular supervisory and credit register data and using a panel difference-in-difference approach, the results show that banks with larger exposure to the increase in geopolitical risk cut lending significantly more than those with smaller exposure.
- Banks with greater exposure raised impairments despite exhibiting similar levels of credit distress to their peers, suggesting that the fall in lending was driven by uncertainty.

**[32] [The protectionist gamble: How tariffs shape greenfield foreign direct investment](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3144~ab18c3e205.en.pdf)**

- Motivated by current events, this paper assesses the impact of tariff increases on bilateral greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI) over the period 2016-2023.
- Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of announced greenfield investment projects, official FDI statistics, and bilateral product-level tariff data, we estimate a series of gravity equations to uncover key relationships.
- Our results show that, at an aggregate level, tariff increases are associated with a rise in greenfield FDI, consistent with the tariff-jumping hypothesis.
- However, this positive effect reverses for greenfield manufacturing FDI, where high-intensity tariff increases significantly deter investment.
